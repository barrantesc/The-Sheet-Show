## What is the point of this app?
This app was designed to help players create a character by using a list or "sheet" of characteristics, similarly to how popular RPG/simluation games allow you to create a character at the start. When the user has created their character, this character and their information is saved inside a mySQL database and can be accessed again when the user logs into the website.
The real-world application of this app could be used for a myriad of different game sites, and could be customizeable based on the ideas of the developers.

## What challenges did we face?
Our main challenge was working on the different files and connecting them to eachother. Thankfully we used class time to get a pulse on where we stood and had steps to complete and move forward before the next class time. Everyone having different strengths and weaknesses was great because for the most part we got to work on things we wanted to, and learn with our group members on things we weren't as strong in.
