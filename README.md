# The-Sheet-Show

## What is the point of this app?
This app was designed to help players create a character by using a list or "sheet" of characteristics, similarly to how popular RPG/simulation games allow you to create a character at the start. When the user has created their character, this character and their information is saved inside a mySQL database and can be accessed again when the user logs into the website.
The real-world application of this app could be used for a myriad of different game sites, and could be customizable based on the ideas of the developers.

## How did we build this app?
Our team (Erik Plachta, Connie Barrantes, Christiana Morales, Mary Margaret Lawton), divvied up the responsibilities based on what our strong suits were. We used the below technologies:
 - Bcrypt
 - Bootstrap
 - Connect-Session-Sequelize
 - Character-Sheet-CSS
 - DnD5e API
 - Dotenv
 - Express
 - Express-Handlebars
 - Express-Session
 - Heroku
 - JawsDB
 - MySQL2
 - Node.js
 - Restful API
 - Sequelize
 
1. To start, we built out Handlebars, our models (Hero, User), and controllers. We also verified that everything was working as expected before moving forward.
2. Next, we worked on bugs we encountered, finishing touches, and improving the overall functionality.
3. Lastly, we worked on the style, images and closing out the remaining github issues.

## What challenges did we face?
Our main challenge was working on the different files and connecting them to each other. Thankfully we used class time to get a pulse on where we stood and had steps to complete and move forward before the next class time. Everyone having different strengths and weaknesses was great because for the most part we got to work on things we wanted to, and learn with our group members on things we weren't as strong in.
